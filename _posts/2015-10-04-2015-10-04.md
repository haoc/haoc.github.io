This week we continued to go over Python concepts of classes, generators, iterators and iterables. I’m going to be honest that I’m still a bit confused on some parts of the concepts. However, going over and working on examples in class really helped me understand the differences between generators, iterators and iterables. 

A generator is an iterator but an iterator is not a generator. Generator is basically an object that has the `next` and `iter` methods and produces a sequence of results instead of a single value. An iterator is an iterable and has the `next` method that returns the next item from the iterator and if there are no more items then a `StopIteration` exception will be raised. Last of all, an iterable is an object that can return an iterator. Please correct me if I’m wrong as I don’t want to confuse anyone!

We will also be having our very first exam this week. I’m really glad that our third project will not be due this week as it gives us more time to study. I feel like the exam will be very straight forward and will be easy as long we really know the concepts that we covered. It also helps that we can have one page of notes. 


## tip-of-the-week

My tip of the week is to do problems on [leecode](https://leetcode.com/) to help you prepare for technical interviews. Even if you only have time to do one problem per day I highly recommend you to do it.
