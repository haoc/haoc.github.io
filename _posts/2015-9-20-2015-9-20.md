This week we talked about our second project, Netflix. The project is really interesting and definitely will take more time than the previous project. My teammate and I have not started on it yet since we are both busy preparing for the career fair that’s coming up but we are confident that we can still finish the project on time.

Speaking of career fair, I’ve been spending a lot of time updating my resume with my internship that I did over the summer and researching for companies that I’m interested in. I’m also taking account on what Chris told us about how companies will also look at if you fit the culture of their companies when I’m researching. This also helps me come up with questions to ask the recruiters. Asking questions will show that you are interested in what they do and leave more of an impression to the recruiters. 


## tip-of-the-week

I encourage everyone to go to the career fair. Just like Professor Downing said, even if you can’t work next summer still go to look around and learn because eventually you will have to go and apply for a job in the future. This will be a good experience to get a feel of what recruiters are looking for, how to talk to them and to get some swags! Seriously though, don’t be afraid to talk to recruiters.  We all get nervous but the more you practice the less you will be and the recruiters are not going to bite you!
