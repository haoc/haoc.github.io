This second week of CS373 Professor Downing went over our first project, Collatz. Our first project isn't difficult to solve, the only difficult part would be to be familiar with the various tools and following all the requirements. I was a bit shocked when I first read through the list of requirements, as 38 is quite a lot of requirements. However, after reading them couple of times I realized they are not all that difficult to do and they are all useful things to learn. Still, I will be starting my projects early and not save them for the last second as the projects will only be getting harder. I learned from CS439 to never, ever start your project late as you never know what bugs you will have or what you are going to be stuck on.

This week we also took couple quizzes, and sadly, I did miss couple questions. I realized I shouldn't skim through the readings as much and should be more thorough. From now on, I will do the readings days before we have the quiz so I can pace myself and finish them on time. 

## tip-of-the-week

Always finish reading the instructions!!! When I started on Collatz, I was stuck on connecting my Travis CI account to my private code repo. Turns out I forgot to add the `.travis.yml` fileâ€¦ It was really embarrassing of  me to be stuck on something that easy, but I learned my lesson to read the instructions from now on no matter how easy I think the task is.
