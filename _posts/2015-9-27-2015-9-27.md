This week was pretty crazy for me as we had our career fair, interviews and Netflix project on the same week. My partner and I started the project late as a result of that and we also kept running into small errors that took us more time than necessary for us to fix. So, sadly we had to turn our project late this week but we definitely learned our lesson to manage our time more wisely.  

Since the first guest talk we had, I’ve been waiting for another one as I really do enjoy these talks and our second guest speaker did not disappoint me at all. Unlike other tech companies, Jet Propulsion Labs are developing new technologies involving robotics and works closely with NASA. I was surprised when I saw JPL used Oculus for their projects, I didn’t realized that Oculus can be used to help us learn more about Mars. It definitely made me think about how technologies are moving so fast as Oculus was created for gaming at first but now it’s used for exploring Mars. JPL definitely look like an awesome place to work where you get to create new technologies to be use by others.


## tip-of-the-week

My tip of the week would be to study everything for the interviews and not just certain topics. I was being naïve and only studied things that people online said was on the interviews for a certain company. However, I was surprised during my interview when they asked me something completely different and I was not prepared for the problems.
