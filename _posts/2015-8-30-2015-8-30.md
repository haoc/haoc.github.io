I know Software Engineering will not be an easy class, but I've heard a lot of good things about the class. After the first week of class, I definitely made the right decision as the materials we will learn will really prepare me for my first job. I was a bit surprised at how Professor Downing will randomly call on people in class as that is something I’m not used to. However, I feel this way people will be more focused and engaging in class.

Group projects will be something I’m looking forward to as I’ve never work with more than one person before in programming assignments. I think it will be a really great experience to have to learn how to work with each other and especially using Git to work together.

I’m a little bit afraid of the workload and the various tools we have to learn but just like what Professor Downing said, in the real world you have to do all of this by yourself. Why not learn and do it right now when we have the resources to prepare for it? I’m really looking forward to what I will be learning in this class.
