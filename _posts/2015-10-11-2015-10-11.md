This week in Software Engineering we went over * and **. We can use them to pass in multiple arguments in a function which I thought was pretty neat. Not only that, we can use them to unpack the arguments just like we packed the arguments. Another thing that was new to me was decorator. Decorators allow you to take in a function and do something to it, then return it. For example, from our Collatz project we had two asserts that we were checking that can become decorators instead. I definitely will try to play with it when I get a chance to as it’s something really new to me.

We also had our first exam this week. It’s actually been a while since I had a coding exam so I was a bit nervous when I was taking the exam. Hopefully I didn’t do that bad as I tend to get really nervous over timed coding exams just like technical interviews, but practice makes perfect!


## tip-of-the-week

If you have worked with CSS before, I recommend you to look into [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/). Sass is an extension of CSS3 but it adds nested rules, variables, mixins, and lots of other fun stuff that makes writing CSS so much easier and cleaner. Along with Sass using something like [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/), a JavaScript task runner, can watch your scss files and compile it to CSS automatically each time you save your scss files. Once you try it, you will probably never go back to regular CSS again.
