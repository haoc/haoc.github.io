This week in Software Engineering we talked about our third project and had a guest speaker from Rackspace to come and explain how to set up a virtual server. My group decided on doing a music web app where we have information about musicians and bands. Each musicians or bands will have information about their releases, videos, awards, bio, and upcoming concerts. I feel like we have a great team as we have people with different strengths and together we can help each other on parts that we are not an expert in. I already have knowledge of databases from taking Data Management and frontend development from my internship so hopefully from these projects I can learn more about the backend where I’m the weakest at. Overall I’m pretty excited for the project and so far we seem to be doing well. 

## tip-of-the-week

My tip of the week is to learn to manage your time well. I recently just started working part-time and I realized that I need to be smart on how I spend my time. This means that I started planning out what I’m doing at each hour instead of doing things whenever I feel like it. Planning out ahead of time makes sure that you have time to finish your work and you have an idea what you need to do and how much time you have to do it. This is pretty similar to working on a project, you need to plan what you need to finish and by when to keep up with the schedule and be able to deliver the finish product on time.
